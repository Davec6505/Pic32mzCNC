Pulse,train control with Trapizodial acc/dec
==================================================
A cnc type control using CIP with pic32mz2048efh          
==================================================


This library drives up to 6 stepper motors using the various Pololu drivers

It uses the Outout capture compares and Timers running in the backgroung freeing up
core to do other tasks, changing OCRx registers results in the change of the interrupt 
frequency, which is how the acc and dec is achieved

Notes
-----------
Code was developed with MikroC Pro for Pic32, it will eventually be a complete code to
use with Clicker2 for pic32mz.
There will be a Shield designed for the Clicker2.
